# Sentinel Memory Bank Architecture

This document describes the structure and file layout initialized by the Sentinel framework. It explains the purpose of each directory and file, ensuring context coherence for AI agents.

## 🔍 Core Memory Bank Files

### 1. `.memory-bank/active-session.json`
Keeps track of the session state. It contains:
- `session_id`: Unique identifier of the current execution.
- `status`: `INITIALIZATION`, `ACTIVE`, `EXECUTION`, or `COMPLETED`.
- `preferred_language`: Custom communication language for user-agent chat.
- Git and worktree details to ensure operations occur in a clean environment.

### 2. `.memory-bank/system-coherence.md`
An automated checklist ensuring the agent verifies environment boundaries, checks git states, logs changes correctly, and adheres to safety policies before and after coding.

### 3. `.memory-bank/migration-map.md`
A registry mapping migrated, superseded, or archived documentation. This prevents historical project knowledge from being lost.

### 4. `.memory-bank/adr/` (Architecture Decision Records)
Markdown files tracking significant engineering decisions (e.g. choice of framework, deployment target, database engine). Structured as:
- **Context:** The issue or requirement.
- **Decision:** The chosen path.
- **Consequences:** Trade-offs and risks.
- **Evidence:** Concrete file references backing the decision.

## 🛡️ Project Specifications (`.specs/`)

- **`bootstrap.md`**: Centralizes dependencies, variables, environment setups, and deployment commands.
- **`boundary-conditions.md`**: Defines hard boundaries (e.g. rate limits, security models, data scopes) the agent must never violate.
- **`constitution.md`**: Project-specific development rules, naming conventions, architectural design patterns, and testing requirements.
